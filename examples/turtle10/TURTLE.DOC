    This unit allows to re-use the Turtle graphics calls in
any graphic mode supported by a BGI driver
    This unit exports all turtle graphics calls present in
TurboPascal V3.0 and in compatibility unit Graph3 provided
with subsequent versions.
    The HiRes and Graphmode calls are not supported  and were
replaced by more general calls
(GraphOn,GraphOff) to accept all standard graphic modes and
drivers.

Why did I wrote that unit ?

    Do you remember that little turtle with a pen at the tail
that was the main feature of the Logo language ? A toy to
learn computers to kids ??? Well not so...

    For my fellow teachers in C.S., turtle graphics are an
exellent introduction to recursion , with  quite attractive
visual effects. Drawing "dragon curves " (Von Koch snowflake,
Peano's curves...) is so natural with this little friendly
animal....

    Another application is in the representation of 2D shapes
by relative motions of the turtle  ; that by a couple (
distance, angle ) from a previous point.  This makes the
manipulation of the shape much easier than with the standard
cartesian coordinates representation.  A translation just
requires changing the starting point of the drawing ;
rotations can be obtained by changing the turtle heading and
zooming is done by changing the pixel/distance ratio for the
turtle motions.  Nearly no trigonometric calculations are
required to transform a shape ...

    Borland had introduced  turtle graphics with TurboPascal 3.
In the subsequent versions, a compatibilt unit, TURBO3 was
provided but, even with version 6, it can only do turtle
graphics in the old CGA graphic modes !!! Quite desappointing
at the era of SVGA boards....

    This  unit , TURTLE.PAS  make possible the use of a turtle
with any graphic mode supported by the Graph unit.  whether it
is a standard graphic mode (EGAVGA,HERC,IBM8570..) or a user
written BGI driver such at the remarkable shareware SVGA
drivers written by .......

    To allow a nearly direct recompilation of previous
programs, the entries points are identical , in names and
parameters with the Turbo3 unit interface.

technical notes:

    This unit has been tested with all  BGI drivers supplied
by Borland Int'l in Turbopascal packages version 5.5  and 6.

    User installed BGI drivers were tested only with SVGA.BGI
driver of J.P.Hardgrave.

    The source code is self-documented.

    Since turtle graphics are done using the LineTo,moveTo
calls to GRAPH, the current point of the graph unit is
synchronized with the turle position. It is therfore possible
to mix turtle graphics and standard BGI graphics. However,
since the turtle is drawn in XOR mode, if a BGI drawn line
cross the turtle image between two moves of the turtle, the
screen image at the turtle previous position  will not be
correctly redrawn   The problem is similar to the handling of
a mouse in text or graphic mode. One has to hide the turtle
before any screen access  and to show it back later.

 We have tried to make this transparent as follow:

To make the Graph unit "turtle-aware ", our solution is to
redefine in the TURTLE unit all screen accessing BGI calls .
Each BGI call has exactly the same name and parmeter that the
original call and simply hides the turtle before calling the
entry point in the Graph unit and show again the turtle upon
return.

   as a exemple the procedure LineTo is redefined as follow :

      Procedure LineTo (X,Y:integer);
       begin
        _HideTurtle;       (* Hide turtle if visible *)
        Graph.lineTo(X,Y); (* call the original BGI driver d'ont
                              forget the Graph. qualifier !!!*)
        _ShowTurtle;       (* show turtle if was  visible *)
       end;

           With  subsequent versions of the GRAPH unit, you
may have to include in the TURTLE unit similar redefinitions
of new screen drawing calls.

    For this  redefinition to work you *must make sure * that
the TURTLE unit is cited *after* the GRAPH unit in the USES
clauses of your client programs.


    In the initialization process , we redefine the EGAVGA
palette for a better rendition of the 16 colors. With others
drivers, you may have to adjust the content of the typed
contant EGAPALETTE.

    To allow "faster trigonometric calculations " we used a
table look up of sines between 0 and 359 degrees. This table
was produced but printing to a text file the result of
10000*Sin(A/PI*180) and subsequent editing.


A ThinkPascal version (for MacIntosh with BW  Quickdraw calls
) is available from the author and could be also placed in the
public domain if enough requests are made....
